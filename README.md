## Description

This repo defines a recipe model for use in recipe-related applications.

The idea is to collect a set of models and core functionality that might be useful to anyone working on recipe or cookbook sites and applications.

The recipe model is based on the [Recipe schema at schema.org](http://schema.org/Recipe).
